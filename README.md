Introduction- 
Lung cancer is one of the main cause of the death and health issue in many countries with a 5-year survival rate of only 10–16%. In this project we use machine learning algorithms to diagnose a cancer and start treatment in early stages. 
         We use KNN & Decision Tree algorithms to predict the accuracy of the cancer. In this project we use scikit-learn libraries like sklearn and pandas to predict and classify the dataset of the lung cancer patients. Slicing the dataset  and feature scaling options are used to train the dataset. After that we use confusion matrix , f1 score and accuracy score to predict the accuracy of the result.




Objectives-
Lung cancer is considered as the deadliest cancer worldwide. For this reason, many countries are developing strategies for the early diagnosis of lung cancer. In this project the objective is to give best result accuracy of lung cancer patients. To achieve this objective, we use KNeighbors Classifiers & Decision Tree algorithm to classify the data set and give the best accuracy of the result. 




Background-
To perform KNN algorithm and Decision Tree algorithm we use scikit-learn library. In background of this project, used libraries are given below-
Numpy - NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
Pandas - Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables
Sklearn - Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support vector machine, random forests, and k-neighbours, and it also supports Python numerical and scientific libraries like NumPy and SciPy.
KNeighbors Classifier - KNN is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm. Non-parametric means there is no assumption for underlying data distribution. All training data used in the testing phase. This makes training faster and testing phase slower and costlier. Costly testing phase means time and memory.
Decision Tree – DTs are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

Future Scope-
The lung cancer detection system using the machine learning technique is much efficient and gives the betterment result to the radiologist and assist them. This enhances with the additional features for upgrading in the future. On this processing system to support the radiologist to detect the affected patients as accurate as the result.


Conclusion-
We processed the dataset to differentiate the affected patient and its level of the growth of the cancer by the machine learning system. Here it presented an approach to find best accuracy of the cancer result to assist the radiologist and for the future enhancement. Further loads ought to be directed at improving the classifying accuracy levels of result through experiments with various alternatives.
